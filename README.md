# User Story
    As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

# Business Context
    An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

# Languages/Web technologies Used: 
    * react.js
    * javascript
    * html
    * css
    * random user api : https://randomuser.me/

# Directions:
    With this application, you are able to search through random dynamically generated names/employees in order to find a specific person.
